# Step 28: Reading events from Smart Contracts

## References:

1.  We will follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX2QOE0FcEo&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgXlCGXNfzKdq7nGBcIaVOdN&index=6) in this step.

In this example we will learn how to read events generated by smart contracts. We will read events from DAI token.

## Step 1

Create `packacge.json`, `tsconfig.json` and `tslint.json` files as in [Step21](../step21_web3_node_getbalance). Also, install the same dependencies, and add the same scripts in `package.json`.

## Step 2

Go to [Dai Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code) on EtherScan. Copy Dai's ABI and contract address. Save the ABI in `abi/dai.json`. On the same page, under the [_events_](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#events) tab, you can see all the latest events generated by Dai's contract. We will fetch these events to our app in the steps to follow.

## Step 3

Create `SmartContract.ts` and `index.ts` files. In `SmartContract.ts` file, replace INFURA_PROJECT_ID with your Infura project ID.

```ts
// Ropsten Test Network endpoint.
const network = "mainnet";
const INFURA_PROJECT_ID = "INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
const RPC_ENDPOINT = `https://${network}.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_PROJECT_ID}`;
```

## Step 4

Run the project with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or with these commands.

```bash
tsc
node index
```
