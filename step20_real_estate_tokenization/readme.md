## The Real-Estate Tokenization Technical Options

1. Tokenize (ERC-20) the LLC that owns and manages the Real-Estate Property
Create an LLC in USA or Dubai for the project and issue ERC 20 Tokens for the LLC in the Global Crypto Market. This will be like raising funds for any project. 
ERC 20 Tokens are easy to understand but we will have do our own crowd sale and its marketing. We will also have to create our own secondary marketplace for ERC 20 Real-Estate Tokens. This is going to be very expensive marketing and development wise. The liquidity of these tokens will be very limited i.e. only in our own marketplace or we will have to register with an exchange.

2. Create Many Separate LLCs for a Independent Unit of Real-Estate

3. Create NFT Collection for the Real-Estate Property
Each NFT will represent a single independent unit of the property i.e. flat or piece of land. The collection will represent the complete property.
The NFTs can be sold on the NFT marketplace like the https://opensea.io/
It will also provide liquidity to the owner because he can sell it easily on the NFT marketplace.
The downside is that NFT price may be high, however this issue can be solved by issuing Fractional NFT's covered in Option 4.
There can also be legal issues as mentioned here ( https://smartcrowd.cc/ ):
Real estate can’t directly be tokenized, but legal entities can. Each property is owned by a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). Each LLC is tokenized to specific RealTokens and made available for purchase.
